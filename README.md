Investment Analysis

Objective

The objective is to identify the best sectors,
countries, and a suitable
investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest
where others are investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are
the ones 'where most investors are investing'.


Analysis


We are using three types of analysis here:
Investment type analysis
: Comparing the typical investment amounts in the venture, seed, angel, private equity etc
Country analysis
: Identifying the countries which have been the most heavily invested in the past. These will be Spark Funds’ favourites as w ell
Sector analysis
: Understanding the distribution of investments across the eight main sectors.

Constraints


Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments
•
Firstly , invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
•
Only invest English speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in
